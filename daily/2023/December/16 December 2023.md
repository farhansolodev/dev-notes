Im thinking i should bite the bullet and learn major backend frameworks, because theyre the only thing that seem to have jobs, even if its hell...

| language | framework |
| -------- | --------- |
| java     | spring    |
| c#       | .NET      |
| php      | laravel   |

Honestly these seem more than enough to land a job...especially if i pair that with proficiency in **mysql**.

There is also cloud devops path which seems to be in demand here.

Theres also AI related jobs but honestly what do AI devs even do?
