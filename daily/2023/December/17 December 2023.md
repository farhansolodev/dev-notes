![[windows executable file headers-20231123040620572.webp|555]]

When trying to run an ELF, Windows doesn't recognize the file header as a Windows executable, nor does it recognize it's header as belonging to any other file type it knows, so it resorts to asking me what program I want to use to "run" this "file". Lol.
