docker - chrooted, namespaced (etc) sandbox with sane seccomp defaults (unless you’re on windows, then it’s a type 1 vm using hyper-v)
ape - compile once run anywhere
nix - OS (packages, scripts, configs) as config
nsjail - one place to configure chroot, namespaces, cgroups, seccomp

Would be nice if all these technologies:
- zerotier
- syncthing
- pairdrop
- movie-web

..all used a single standard protocol for server/peer discovery and data relaying. Or atleast they could add a plugin system where you get to add in a discovery & relaying mechanism.

Idk. Maybe it doesnt really make sense for pairdrop & movie-web.

Also, remember to install these on laptop:
- spotube
- pairdrop (pwa) also probably permalink to other devices
- movie-web (pwa)
