Since i'm not very good at talking about myself and not exactly a fan of writing introductions even if they might turn out good after some effort, instead of having some brief autobiography and "thoughtful" statements and clever quips on the home page i'll have a couple sections to lead readers to what's most relevant:

- a section for my most recently[^1] published posts
- a section for my most recently[^1] edited thoughts
- a section for my most widely used tags

Each section should have a "View more" button of sorts.

I like [Jacky's tags](https://jzhao.xyz/tags/). I think I will use some of them for myself because they make sense to use. His tags also seem to draw parallels with PARA.

Perhaps I could use a combination of both, but I don't know...

\#reflection also seems like a tag that I would use quite heavily ðŸ˜….

[^1]: past month/week or a numeric limit, whichever looks nicer
