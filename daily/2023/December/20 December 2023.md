quartz is nice but there is still work to do:
- [x] do something about the embed links (just don't use them lol)
- [ ] do something about the numbers in the image links for resizing because quartz doesnt support that either
- [ ] add a nicer index.md
- [ ] rethink which folder i should really serve notes from
     Maybe quartz has an include flag for assets, check that.
     `index.md` in vault root is ew, unless I have a separate vault dedicated to my blog but that seems like too much work unless I have some command which quickly copies files over (maybe using `rsync`) to that vault. But then again I have to think about linked assets - i'd need to copy them over too...
- [ ] fix layout, a tiny explorer tab on the left really isn't cutting it for navigability
