So *JPEG* is a lossy codec, and *JFIF* & *Exif* are containers/file formats. But unlike video, the file extension for these JPEG encoded images isn't named after the container, it's just named `.jpeg/.jpg`, i.e: it's named after the codec. So confusing! 

I mean I guess with this method you at least know what encoding you're getting.
The question is, what's more convenient? Having the extension be the codec or the container? 
And what's more, what's more annoying? Not immediately knowing the encoding or the container type (metadata format)?
