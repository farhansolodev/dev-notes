TL;DR: `sshd_config` is now at `C:\ProgramData\ssh\sshd_config`
From [this medium article:](https://medium.com/@marc.herbert/the-sshd-config-default-file-in-c-windows-system32-openssh-is-misleading-dont-waste-your-time-414a67ea3334)

>The sshd_config_default file in C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\ is misleading, don’t waste your time in that folder. The default location for the configuration file is now C:\ProgramData\ssh\sshd_config
>
>I eventually found __PROGRAMDATA__ by running “strings” on sshd.exe! Of course once I knew the answer my Google searches instantly started returning many pages with that answer… :-(

>This cost me hours, including how to configure Windows services and what not. You can indeed override the location in the Windows services registry but probably not much point once you know where the default location is.
