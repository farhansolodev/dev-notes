[About Plex Direct Play & Direct Stream](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200250387-streaming-media-direct-play-and-direct-stream/). Quite useful tbh.

This is concerning though:
![[IMG_6672.jpeg]]

I set “Burn Subtitles” to “Never” on the TV. Although if I try to use `.ASS`/`.SSA` subtitles they simply wouldn’t show up as Plex does not support them. So I’m going to have to pre-download subtitles for every episode/movie 😕.

**Job application to Fliki**:

My experience as a full-stack software engineer at Newsreels rings extremely similiar to the work being done at Fliki.

Newsreels as a startup operated in the entertainment/news aggregation business, using AI to serve content to users that need it. My work at Newsreels involved interfacing with their existing AI systems to shape how content is presented to these users.

The job involved me owning and building microservices on top of Docker and Kubernetes using Node.js, React & Typescript. Within React, it was the "Remotion" library that I used extensively.

These microservices would interface with MongoDB on a separate pod that would serve as the source of truth for all services.

My React work involved me regularly translating UIs into frontends that had a 0 tolerance policy when it came to being "not responsive", due to the nature of the product.

I have far more than working knowledge when it comes to SQL, and have done enough NoSQL professionally or academically to be comfortable with it.

The job even involved me designing platform architecture for a new product that the company wanted to pitch to a Facebook startup program, which I had done but had left before beginning implementation.

My experience at Newsreels has familiarized me with working within an automated CI/CD workflow, albeit I did not implement those workflows myself.

I worked with the CEO very closely and we regularly had discussions on how my service should behave.

I have a Bachelors degree in CompSci, where I lead 2 software projects both as technical lead, product & project manager.

 I am also an aficionado of git :)

My experience at Newsreels was very memorable and a great learning experience, which I only quit because of external pressures and responsibilities. Working there made me love software engineering and I hope to feel that adoration for the craft once again at Fliki.

Thankyou for reading this far
