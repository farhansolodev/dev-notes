[Task Manager CPU usage now takes clock speed into account for their CPU utilization metric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/performance/cpu-usage-exceeds-100). Just when I thought I understood it ðŸ™ƒ. HWiNFO is very aware of this:

[Explanation of effective clock vs core clock on the HWiNFOÂ® Forum by HWiNFO author](https://www.hwinfo.com/forum/threads/effective-clock-vs-instant-discrete-clock.5958/).

[CPU multiplier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_multiplier) seems to be what "ratio" is here:

Basically these values:

Interesting! I mentioned p-states in [[12 December 2023]].

>[Race-to-sleep](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/race-to-sleep) (sometimes Race-to-Dark or Race-to-Idle/Halt/Zero) is a common power-saving technique used in most modern high-performance integrated circuits whereby the chip enters its highest operating frequency in order to complete the workload as fast as possible in order to go back to sleep or its lowest operating frequency.

#power
So that's why CPU cores mostly are not active and instead we see bursts like this:
![[Pasted image 20240704201139.png|550]]
Because <1600MHz the `"change in power consumption" x frequency` curve flattens out. This is called "static power leakage" so race-to-sleep is done to "reduce the static power consumption, thereby consuming significantly less power overall".

I guess that curve would look something like this:

Another way of looking at it would be that "required voltage is sub-linear at the low end and super-linear at the high end".

["There is a timing signal (typically produced by a quartz oscillator) that synchronises the internal operation of the CPU. This clock signal is the system clock."](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/121955/bus-and-system-clocks) TIL more about quartz oscillators (it's the thing that looks like it's being held).

From [r/explainlikeimfive](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/9u8z3s/eli5_what_are_the_quartz_crystals_on_computer_cpus/):
> Imagine the crystal is a thin little square of glass with a piece of aluminum foil glued on either side. The crystal has a property called piezoelectric which means that if you bend the crystal, it makes a very small voltage between the foil sheets glued onto the sides. Likewise if you put a small voltage on the sheets, the crystal bends.
> 
> In operation, the crystal operates like the old school pendulum on a grandfather clock. It goes tick-tock-tick-tock, bending back and forth. You hook it to some circuitry that makes it continue to go and forth. Kind of like if you hit it with a hammer and it goes to the left, and you let it bounce back to the right, and hit it again just when it starts going left to keep it going.

> The crystal is super accurate and makes a great clock.
