h264/avc videos take up larger space than h265/hevc videos on disk for the same quality. 

Now, I know that h264 is wayyy more compressed than lossless video encodings, but the h265 encoding still manages to compress it much further. As a penalty though h265 incurs higher decoding & encoding latency.

# Decoding vs Encoding

Decoding a video file is much like uncompressing a tarball, because all video encodings/codecs are essentially compression algorithms, and containers like mp4 & mkv simply package those compressed video files. As such, for an application to play a video file it has to constantly decode chunks of the file at a time. The strategy the application chooses to do this I think is largely up to the program but I assume it also depends on the encoding, if not also the container.

And just like with compressing a file or directory into a tarball, the smaller you want to make it the longer it will take, and this principle applies to encoding videos (from say, a video editor) as well.

# How video is consumed and where it comes from

When it comes to streaming though, I guess the “storage” becomes the network itself. So encoding is the process of writing a compressed version of some video content to not just disk, but to anything, including the network, at-least when live-streaming.

>So the disk is synonymous with the network. This fits in very well with how UNIX treats everything like a file that you can just write to.

This “video content” could either be produced digitally (like raw pixel data from a screen share) or produced from a camera (in the form of an intraframe encoded file like ProRes).

# Streaming vs Live-streaming

I’d like to describe video files as “static” video: basically files that don’t change as they are being played. 

Watching “static” videos either locally on a player or over the network on Youtube or Plex, seems like a “pull” model. I don’t know how a video player or a video server works, but I assume they wait for instructions from the consumer before decoding anything. But yes, obviously it is possible to preconfigure some settings into the decoding software, such as “always buffer 30 minutes of video ahead of time”. Obviously different configurations will yield differing performance/behavior, but nonetheless those decisions are solving problems within the “pull” domain.

Live-streaming on the other hand seems like a “push” model, as the encoding software does not have to care about what the consumer wants. I guess more of the complexity burden is put on the client. 

Obviously I can be drastically wrong about this but this is how I think about it at 4am lol.

Also, for streaming “static” video, since the files are already in a particular encoding, the video server just needs to write the file to network. With live-streaming, the server has to constantly encode whatever it wants to stream to a compressed version (h264/5 etc.) for lower bandwidth streams.

# h264 vs h265 streaming

Since “static” video files just need to be written to network, it doesn’t really matter how good the video server’s encoder is, since its not doing anything.

Therefore, it is only a matter of bandwidth. Unless h264 videos somehow yield better quality videos (due to less compression artifacts maybe) than h265 videos, it would always be a better idea to pre-encode videos into h265 especially if bandwidth is a concern. I don’t really see a downside pre-googling stuff and post-shitty memory.

As for live-streaming, both codecs are double-edged swords. Live encoding h264 would be faster but require higher bandwidth, whereas h265 would be slower but require lower bandwidth.

Therefore, I think that for a sufficiently powerful encoder that is capable of handling all of it’s load, h265 should be used. Because logically, the more powerful an encoder gets, the less real world difference in latency between h264 & h265, i.e: being twice as fast is less significant if the difference is 50ms vs if the difference is 5s.

# Static video streaming clients

Well now at least I know to avoid transcoding like the plague. But there is still the question of decoding performance.

Now and then the living room TV takes ages to start a movie/episode and is also very slow to scrub, despite being right next to the access point.

While this *could* be due to a number of reasons:
- slow HDD speeds
- possible on-demand thumbnail generation
- possibly overwhelming the router/switch/access point 

I have a sneaking suspicion the slowdown is simply caused by the TV not having enough juice to decode the video fast enough. Either the bottleneck is it’s CPU, its RAM, its decoder, or some combination of them all.

#todo
I should really do some profiling to find this bottleneck 

# Containers

#til
[This](https://youtu.be/-4NXxY4maYc?si=iIYoVbPNpv7sP2-b) is a very good video explaining codecs and containers. It’s where I learned today that containers like MP4 (and MKV) are wrappers for different types of content, a lot like a zipped file format (.zip, .docx etc). This content usually comprises of:
- a video stream
- audio stream(s)
- subtitle file(s)
- metadata

The video stream cannot really live on its own. If you extract it, it would just have to go into another container. Same goes for the audio stream: it would simply have to go into an audio container like MP3 or even MP4 since it isn’t illegal for an MP4 file to not have a video stream.

I’ve heard MKVs are generally a better format/container nowadays than MP4 due to quality of life improvements. Uploaders apparently package subtitles into MKV files more often than with MP4 files, which is kinda funny although I don’t know how true this is. MKV also supports being packaged in with .ASS subtitles, although a client can obviously play an MP4 file with external .ASS subtitles, so it doesn’t seem like too huge a deal.
