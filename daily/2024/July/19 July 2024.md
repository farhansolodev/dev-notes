BarrerKVM v2.4.0 (released in Nov 2021) is broken because of some regressions in past commits. Since then there have been multiple commits that fix these regressions and they have even been merged to the main branch but there hasn't been an official release since 2021. Fortunately, they've provided links to their Azure DevOps Pipeline which *does* include the latest build artifacts, and can be found [here](https://dev.azure.com/debauchee/Barrier/_build/results?buildId=782&view=logs&j=24388e35-e6df-5887-84af-0e3f29f025d0).
