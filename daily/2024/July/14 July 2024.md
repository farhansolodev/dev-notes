## Zonal Auxiliary Languages:

### Indo-European

But concerned with only European

![[IMG_6810.png]]

##### Romantic

**Romance Neolatino?**

It seems French people can’t quite understand Neolatin, and I also don’t think I would understand French either, so probably for this family, the move is to learn *Neolatin* & *French*.

##### Germanic

**Folksprak?**

Potentially needs to be split into:
- North Germanic: *Swedish, Danish, Norwegian* & *Icelandic*
- West Germanic: *Dutch* & *German*

##### Slavic

**Interslavic**

##### Baltic

Yet to be seen. May be covered by *Interslavic*.

##### Greek, Albanian, Armenian

Bit of dark horses these ones

---
### Uralic

Covers *Hungarian*, *Finnish* & *Estonian*

---
### Turkic

Covers a whole lot of countries
