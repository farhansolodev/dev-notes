- *Vite* uses *esbuild* under the hood to transpile Typescript in `development`, but it doesn't do any typechecking because it's way faster. This is fine if your IDE is running `tsc` in the background to show type errors as you're coding. In `production`, you will want to run `tsc` before building.
- It also uses *esbuild* to transpile JSX, and while it uses *Babel* to do that in `production`, it will still use *esbuild* if no *Babel* plugins are used.
