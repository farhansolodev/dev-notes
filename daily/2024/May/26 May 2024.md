```Typescript
/**
 * The response from this middleware would normally be blocked by CORS anyway
 * due to the lack of the 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true' header,
 * but for requests from outside the browser, this short circuits the response.
 */
export const handleRedundantAuthentication: RequestHandler = (req, res, next) => {
    throwIfCookieKeyDoesNotExist()
    if (!!signedCookie(req.headers.cookie!, process.env.SESSION_SECRET!)) {
		
		// user is already authenticated, doesn't need to do it again
        res.status(409).json({
            success: false,
            reason: "already-authenticated"
        })
        return
    }

	next()
}
```

I'm actually so dumb. I did this instead of simply checking if the user already exists. Somehow I completely missed that someone can try to authenticate twice *without* sending cookies 🤦‍♂️. 

I guess the lesson is don't do any sort of complex logic around cookies since their behavior varies widely from site to site and from browser to non-browser.
