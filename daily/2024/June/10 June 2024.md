# Invariants

These are assumptions you make about the state of your program. These assumptions must hold, otherwise your program is fundamentally in a broken state.

One approach from ThePrimeagen:

>imagine you have a private function that requires some state of the world to exist. it MUST NOT BE CALLED EVER without that. So if it breaks from its REQUIREMENT crash the program with the state that lead up to this and that way you can fix your program based on the state that lead to the issue

I think the basic idea is that if you handle the violation of an invariant instead of crashing, then at best your program is designed poorly, and at worst, your program goes into an invalid state from which you won't be able to debug what caused the violation.

An example[^2]:

Usually, type systems cannot enforce invariants at compile time, although some are better at doing this than others, such as Idris[^1]:

Other type systems such as C++ enforce invariants via OOP:

[^1]: It's interesting that having dependant types leads to worse type inference.
[^2]: Although if the program kept the `members` field optional and made it so that the field is undefined at runtime until it has atleast 1 element, the `isMemberOf` function could be made to only accept a concrete `members` field.
