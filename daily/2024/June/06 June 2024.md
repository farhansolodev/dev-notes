# Promise.withResolvers()

Can use this to turn a stream into an async iterable:
```js
async function* readableToAsyncIterable(stream) {
  let { promise, resolve, reject } = Promise.withResolvers();
  stream.on("error", (error) => reject(error));
  stream.on("end", () => resolve());
  stream.on("readable", () => resolve());

  while (stream.readable) {
    await promise;
    let chunk;
    while ((chunk = stream.read())) {
      yield chunk;
    }
    ({ promise, resolve, reject } = Promise.withResolvers());
  }
}
```

# Event loop

Man I feel like I understand this shit so well now. I can like predict logs and shit, so I know which tasks will run first and which will get queued up to run and which will get starved or if they will interleave. 

That excalidraw I made, [this video about the various task queues in the browser and in node](https://youtu.be/u1kqx6AenYw?si=hzHFdF3PUKwyyFUE), [this clip showing the differences in behavior between the different queues](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx6sqcRzoOjYSrnA8cFGMzuFTSoWp1Dpz_?si=UlkGRIMpAZKO0ddU), and probably more that I've missed.

Oh there's also: [Node.js — The Node.js Event Loop](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/asynchronous-work/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick).

# MySQL notes

From [How To Install MySQL on Ubuntu 22.04 | DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-22-04):
>In Ubuntu systems running MySQL 5.7 (and later versions), the root MySQL user is set to authenticate using the `auth_socket` plugin by default rather than with a password. This plugin requires that the name of the operating system user that invokes the MySQL client matches the name of the MySQL user specified in the command, so you must invoke `mysql` with `sudo` privileges to gain access to the root MySQL user.

Changed this behaviour via:
`ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';`
...where `'password'` is a string that can be anything.

# Laravel notes

[Service Containers](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/container#zero-configuration-resolution) allow certain sections of a laravel project to use classes without *explicitly* importing them. This does not seem to be the case within Service Provider files though - they seem to require explicit imports.

It is confusing which files can be auto imported and which can't. It seems controllers *can* be auto imported.

To remove a controller as well as it's associated data, you have to separately remove the controller code *as well as* rollback the appropriate migration(s).

# Laravel-admin notes

>[Laravel-admin has Arbitrary File Upload **vulnerability** · CVE-2023-24249 · GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g857-47pm-3r32)

Creating a fresh Laravel project comes *with* a `create_users` migration and `User` model but **no** `UserController`.
```bash
laravel new example-app
```

Requiring `laravel-admin` doesn't do anything except make a new entry in the `vendor/` directory.
```bash
composer require encore/laravel-admin
```

Publishing `laravel-admin`'s `AdminServiceProvider` copies a new `create-admin` migration into the project workspace as well as creates a `config/admin.php` file.
```bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Encore\\Admin\\AdminServiceProvider"

   INFO  Publishing assets.

  Copying directory [vendor/encore/laravel-admin/config] to [config] ......................................... DONE
  Copying directory [vendor/encore/laravel-admin/resources/lang] to [lang] ................................... DONE
  Copying directory [vendor/encore/laravel-admin/database/migrations] to [database/migrations] ............... DONE
  Copying directory [vendor/encore/laravel-admin/resources/assets] to [public/vendor/laravel-admin] .......... DONE
```

Finally, installing `laravel-admin` uses that `config/admin.php` file to:
- create a migrations table
- run all of the existing migrations
- install a `HomeController` into the directory specified by the `directory` key in `config/admin.php`.

```bash
$ php artisan admin:install
