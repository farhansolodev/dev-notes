- Use existing assets, contacts, knowledge first, then try to do something that uses things you don't have control over
- Need a boring money maker for structure
- Make use of existing tools instead of trying to be complex yourself (Coca cola and fridge example)
- Need some beliefs to keep going without logic (can be seen in psychology or when people use religion to overcome distress). Extrapolating from this, every successful entrepreneur sets some minimum requirements for any venture (eg: need to spend x amount of money and x amount of man hours). The actual numbers are from some acquired wisdom, but additionally these goals/beliefs create motivation, and ultimately the mere act of consistency and just doing the thing makes success more and more likely. In contrast, someone who just blindly starts a venture without any goals or beliefs will likely give up way sooner.
- Those that have no choice but to do some business to make some money, will always end up ahead of someone who is sitting and thinking of what is the best business for him to start.
