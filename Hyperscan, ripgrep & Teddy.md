[Hyperscan](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/introduction-to-hyperscan.html) is a regex lib developed by Intel that is *apparently* the fastest regex lib atleast as of July 2023. It is super hardware accelerated, especially so on Intel CPUs, but I haven't yet looked up if it is the fastest *only* if run on Intel CPUs.
Anyway, supposedly Intel invented a novel SIMD accelerated multiple substring matching algorithm for use in this lib. They call it "Teddy". This algorithm has inspired open source projects ever since Hyperscan was itself [open sourced](https://github.com/intel/hyperscan) in 2015.
One of these projects is `ripgrep` by BurntSushi, which is apparently [faster than {grep, ag, git grep, ucg, pt, sift}](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/). This project [implements](https://github.com/BurntSushi/aho-corasick) the Aho–Corasick algorithm, which itself [includes](https://github.com/BurntSushi/aho-corasick/tree/4499d7fdb41c6279ea1367bccf3daca9cb06c36c/src/packed/teddy) an implementation of Intel's Teddy.
An interesting thing about this implementation is that it’s got a quadratic worst case time complexity, but for short patterns (which is what most regexes are used for) it beats every other algorithm.
